# DNS Resolution Failure for Internal Services

## Summary
Internal DNS server became unresponsive, causing widespread service discovery failures across the entire infrastructure. All inter-service communication failed.

## Impact
- Complete platform outage
- All services unable to communicate
- 25 minutes of total downtime
- Estimated $85,000 in lost revenue
- 1,200+ customer support contacts

## Timeline
- 08:15 UTC: DNS server unresponsive
- 08:16 UTC: Cascade failures across all services
- 08:17 UTC: Multiple PagerDuty alerts triggered
- 08:20 UTC: War room initiated
- 08:25 UTC: Identified DNS server issue
- 08:35 UTC: Restarted DNS service
- 08:40 UTC: Services began recovering

## Root Cause
The internal DNS server exhausted available memory due to a query amplification attack from a misconfigured service that was recursively querying non-existent domains. The server lacked rate limiting and had insufficient memory allocated.

## Resolution
1. Restarted DNS service to restore functionality
2. Identified and fixed misconfigured service
3. Implemented DNS query rate limiting
4. Increased DNS server memory from 4GB to 16GB
5. Deployed secondary DNS server for redundancy

## Prevention
- Deploy DNS in high-availability configuration
- Implement DNS query rate limiting per service
- Add DNS server health monitoring
- Set up DNS query pattern anomaly detection
- Create DNS failover automation
- Document DNS recovery procedures
- Conduct DNS failure simulation quarterly
