# Third-Party Payment Gateway Outage

## Summary
Primary payment gateway experienced complete outage lasting 90 minutes. Lack of fallback provider caused all payment processing to fail.

## Impact
- 1,247 failed payment transactions
- $89,400 in blocked revenue
- Customer complaints and cart abandonments
- Duration: 90 minutes
- 12% of customers switched to competitors

## Timeline
- 16:00 UTC: Payment gateway outage began
- 16:02 UTC: First payment failures detected
- 16:05 UTC: Error rate at 100% for payments
- 16:08 UTC: War room initiated
- 16:15 UTC: Confirmed third-party provider outage
- 16:30 UTC: Began emergency integration with backup provider
- 17:15 UTC: Backup provider integration deployed
- 17:30 UTC: Primary gateway restored
- 18:30 UTC: Reprocessed failed transactions

## Root Cause
The third-party payment gateway experienced a database failure on their end. Our service had no fallback provider configured and no circuit breaker to degrade gracefully. The payment processing was single-point-of-failure on external provider.

## Resolution
1. Accelerated integration with secondary payment provider
2. Deployed emergency failover logic
3. Implemented provider health checks
4. Added automatic failover between providers
5. Reprocessed all failed transactions
6. Issued customer communications and apologies

## Prevention
- Maintain active integrations with multiple payment providers
- Implement automatic failover for critical third-party services
- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Create degraded mode (cash-on-delivery, invoice) as fallback
- Set up provider SLA monitoring and alerting
- Conduct quarterly failover drills
- Establish vendor communication channels for outages
- Add transaction queuing for retry on recovery
- Document third-party dependency risks in architecture reviews
