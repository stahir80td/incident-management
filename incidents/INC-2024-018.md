# DDoS Attack on Public API

## Summary
Large-scale distributed denial of service attack overwhelmed public API infrastructure, causing complete service outage for legitimate users.

## Impact
- Complete API unavailability for 1 hour 15 minutes
- 2.3 million malicious requests
- Legitimate traffic dropped by 95%
- Infrastructure costs spike: $8,400 in bandwidth
- 45 enterprise customers affected

## Timeline
- 19:30 UTC: Traffic spike detected - 50x normal volume
- 19:32 UTC: API response times degraded
- 19:35 UTC: Complete service saturation
- 19:37 UTC: DDoS attack confirmed
- 19:40 UTC: War room initiated
- 19:50 UTC: Activated DDoS mitigation service
- 20:15 UTC: Attack traffic blocked at edge
- 20:45 UTC: Service restored to normal
- 21:30 UTC: Attack ended

## Root Cause
A coordinated DDoS attack originating from 12,000+ IP addresses targeted the public API endpoints. The attack used legitimate-looking requests but at massive scale. No DDoS protection was active at the edge network layer.

## Resolution
1. Activated cloud provider's DDoS protection service
2. Implemented IP-based rate limiting at WAF
3. Blocked top attacking IP ranges
4. Added CAPTCHA for suspicious traffic patterns
5. Scaled infrastructure to absorb remaining attack traffic

## Prevention
- Keep DDoS protection active permanently
- Implement multi-layer rate limiting (IP, user, endpoint)
- Add traffic pattern anomaly detection
- Create DDoS response playbook
- Establish relationship with ISP for upstream filtering
- Configure automatic scaling triggers for traffic spikes
- Add geographic traffic filtering options
- Conduct DDoS simulation tests quarterly
- Pre-position additional infrastructure capacity
