# Configuration Drift in Monitoring Infrastructure

## Summary
Manual configuration changes to monitoring servers caused drift from infrastructure-as-code templates, leading to alerting failures and gaps in observability.

## Impact
- 23 alerts silently failing
- 6 hours of missing metrics data
- 2 incidents detected late due to missing alerts
- Production outages went undetected for 15 minutes

## Timeline
- 09:00 UTC: Manual config change to monitoring server
- 09:00-15:00 UTC: Alerts silently failing
- 15:00 UTC: Separate incident occurred but no alerts
- 15:15 UTC: Incident detected manually by customers
- 15:30 UTC: Investigation revealed missing alerts
- 16:00 UTC: Discovered configuration drift
- 16:45 UTC: Restored monitoring from IaC templates
- 17:30 UTC: Verified all alerts functioning

## Root Cause
An engineer made manual configuration changes to fix a perceived issue but didn't update the infrastructure-as-code templates. The next automated deployment overwrote these changes, inadvertently breaking alert routing. No drift detection was in place.

## Resolution
1. Restored monitoring configuration from source control
2. Identified and re-applied valid manual changes to IaC
3. Redeployed monitoring infrastructure
4. Verified all alerting channels functional
5. Back-filled missing metrics where possible

## Prevention
- Implement configuration drift detection and alerts
- Require all changes via infrastructure-as-code
- Add pre-commit hooks to validate IaC changes
- Create monitoring configuration change process
- Set up automated compliance scanning
- Implement read-only access to production configs
- Add configuration versioning and audit logging
- Conduct monthly configuration drift audits
- Create self-service IaC change templates
