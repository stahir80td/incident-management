# SSL Certificate Expiration on API Gateway

## Summary
The SSL certificate for api.company.com expired, causing all API requests to fail with certificate validation errors. External partners and mobile applications were unable to connect.

## Impact
- Complete API outage for external consumers
- 12,450 failed API requests
- 89 customer support tickets filed
- Duration: 1 hour 38 minutes
- Affected 23 third-party integrations

## Timeline
- 03:00 UTC: Certificate expired
- 03:12 UTC: PagerDuty alerts triggered for API health checks
- 03:15 UTC: On-call engineer identified certificate expiration
- 03:25 UTC: Generated new certificate via Let's Encrypt
- 04:30 UTC: Certificate deployed and validated
- 04:38 UTC: All services confirmed operational

## Root Cause
The SSL certificate was set to expire on February 3rd, 2024. While automated renewal was configured, it failed silently due to a DNS validation issue that was not monitored. The renewal process had been failing for 30 days without triggering alerts.

## Resolution
1. Manually generated and installed new certificate
2. Fixed DNS TXT record for ACME validation
3. Verified automatic renewal process
4. Tested renewal in staging environment

## Prevention
- Implement certificate expiration monitoring with 60, 30, and 7-day warnings
- Add alerts for failed renewal attempts
- Create automated daily validation of certificate renewal process
- Document manual certificate renewal procedure
- Set up backup certificate provider
- Add certificate expiration checks to weekly operations review
